        <p>Previously, my work was focused on verifying the credit worthiness of the borrower and assessing the submitted collaterals like real estate, vehicle, or a business. Regardless, I was still doing some responsibilities from my previous positions since the company is small organization with around 35 employees.</p>

            <p> Moving on, I am now pursuing a career in the IT field more specifically in web development. I studied programming when I was in college since my course specializes in business management and technology. I undertook programming courses (C, C++, HTML & CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Database Management), networking and SAP. To attain what I envisioned, I have been on self-taught journey to acquire skills related to web development from July 2022 up to present. On the side, I have worked on my skills as well for photography, graphic and web design, and traditional and digital drawing. Some tools I utilize include Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Canva and some design theory from basic to intermediate level of expertise. .

            <p>On a personal note, I like reading fiction novels, surfing the internet, and sometimes, practice my creativity in photography and graphic designing. My personal mantra is believing that everything happens for a reason and that whatever is meant for me will find its way to me in God’s perfect time. </p>
